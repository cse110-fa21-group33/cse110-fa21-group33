    "description": "Need some extra spice in your life? This Spicy Habanero Salsa is the perfect snack with lots of spice and flavor - Super Bowl party favorite!\nI love a spicy salsa and making it fresh at home is always a good idea.\n\nI recommend starting with 1 habanero and then increasing the heat from there. Peppers can vary in spice - so you may get one that is a dud and another that is spicy as hell. So add carefully.\n\nOh, and did I mention, there are also jalapenos in this salsa? I like having both since I think they bring different qualities to the table. Jalapeno has spice, but also a nice flavor. Habanero doesn't have as much flavor, but really ups the spice level.",
