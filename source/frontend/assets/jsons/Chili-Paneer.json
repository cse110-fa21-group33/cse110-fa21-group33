    "Combine the sauce ingredients in a bowl with 100ml/3½fl oz water and set aside.",
    "Pour the vegetable oil into a heavy-bottomed pan or a deep-fat fryer and heat to 180C, or until a cube of bread turns golden-brown in 15 seconds. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.)",
    "Combine the plain flour, cornflour, chilli powder, chilli flakes and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add 80ml/2½fl oz water a little at a time and whisk to make a sticky batter. You’ll need to keep stirring it to keep it loose! Coat a few paneer pieces in the batter and deep-fry for 3–4 minutes until crisp and golden. Drain on kitchen paper and batter then deep-fry the remaining paneer cubes in batches.",
    "To make the chilli paneer, place a large wok over a medium flame and add the vegetable oil. When the oil is hot, add the spring onions and garlic, fry for a minute, then add the green chillies, peppers and red onion. Fry for 3 minutes, stirring well, then add the sauce mixture along with the salt and pepper. Simmer over a low heat for 1 minute.",
    "Mix the cornflour with a tablespoon of cold water in a small bowl, and add this to the wok. Cook for 2 minutes until it thickens. Finally, add the crispy fried paneer and the spring onion greens and mix thoroughly to coat everything in the sauce. Serve immediately."
