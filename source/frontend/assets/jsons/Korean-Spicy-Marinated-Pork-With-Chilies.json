  "title": "Korean Spicy Marinated Pork With Chilies",
  "id": "Y2R21c",
  "description": "There are too many great meat dishes in the Korean canon to pick a favorite, but this one of stir-fried marinated pork with kimchi is definitely in my top five. Easy to make, it features thin strips of pork shoulder in a spicy-sweet blend of Korean chili paste, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oilâ€”plus a bit of Asian pear for both flavor and its tenderizing effect.",
