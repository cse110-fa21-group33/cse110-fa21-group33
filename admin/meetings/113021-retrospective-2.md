- What went well/what didn't
    - Went well
        - Overall the sprint went well
        - Extremely productive sprint, we got a functioning SPA in one day
        - Everyone has been attending meetings
    - Wasn't well
        - Not everyone did their asynchronous standups
        - We kinda threw the subteams out the window. People are working on specific tasks based on priority over team-related.
        - Merge Conflicts!!
