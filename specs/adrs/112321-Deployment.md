# Deployment Decision

* Status: Accepted <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: Everyone
* Date: November 23, 2021 <!-- optional -->


## Context and Problem Statement

Throughout the planning process, our team had initially explored and considered Firebase as a viable option for backend infrastructure and hosting.
We were strongly advised by our TA, however, that we should pursue a less 'complicated' hosting service such as Github pages instead. After lecture on
deployability, our team realized that the advice to utilize Github pages did not suit our team's needs for a deployable service that worked well with
our build pipline.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* What service can we use to host our application?
* Will this service make deploying code streamline?
* What is the learning curve required to use said service?

## Considered Options

* Heroku
* Netlify

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: After experimenting and researching as a group, we decided that Netlify would be the most suitable service for our needs.

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Streamline code deployability straight from Github commits
* Easily visible and accessible
* Free

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* Learning curve required by team to utilize service
