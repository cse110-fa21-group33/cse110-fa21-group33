# Challenge Decision

* Status: Accepted <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: Everyone
* Date: December 02, 2021 <!-- optional -->


## Context and Problem Statement

Originally we had planned to have a favorite recipe feature to display on the right side of the main page. However, given the current timeframe, we will not have the capabilities of implementing such a feature. Now, we have a blank right side of the main page making it look somewhat barren and lopsided.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* The main page looks somewhat barren, how should we fix this?
* How do we make the page look more balanced?
* How do we deal with the extra white space in the main page?

## Considered Options

* Add a diffuser section that will contain images of foods that might help with the spicy foods
* Keep the layout at it is
* Keep the same layout, but instead, extend the recommended recipe box to hold more recipes per row

## Decision Outcome

* Keep the same layout, but instead, extend the recommended recipe box to hold more recipes per row

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* We don't have to implement a favorite recipe feature in a short timespan
* We will be able to fill up the space on the right side
* The main page won't look too crowded having different cards for the viewer (this is especially helpful to mobile viewers)
* Viewing 4 cards per row actually looks nicer

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* A diffuse section would a fun add on
